# p5play template

This is a template repo that includes the following libraries:

* [p5 & p5.sound](https://p5js.org/download/)
* [p5play & planck](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play)

See the links for license information.

`sketch.js` has a very simple game to demonstrate a few features of the p5play library. (Since it's hosted via GitHub Pages, you can [play it here](https://fsudigitalmedia.github.io/p5play_template/)). Wipe it out and make your own game! (After you record your high score, of course.)

## Notes

If you want to include sound, be sure to uncomment the line in `index.html` that includes the `p5.sound` library.

Finally, change the title in `index.html` and replace the contents of this `README.md` file with information about the game you've created.
